## NFL 2021 Passing Plays Dataset

Downloaded dataset from `nflfastr` package

.pull-left[

- **19997** observations (passing plays), **36** variables

- All passing plays from 2021 season

- categorical variables: qb hit, pass completions, game half

- continuous variables: air yards, EPA, half seconds remaining

]

.pull-right[

- Data relating to:
  - passer
  - receiver
  - teams
  - time
  - position + length of pass
  - epa, wpa

]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(nfl_passing_plays %>%
                    select(passer_player_name, posteam, complete_pass, air_yards, half_seconds_remaining, qb_hit, epa), 4), 
            col.names = c("Player Name", 
                          "Team", 
                          "Completion", 
                          "Air Yards",
                          "Half Seconds Rem.",
                          "QB Hit",
                          "EPA"),format = 'html')
```

## The Importance of the Offensive Line: QBs are Less Likely to Complete Pass When Hit

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
# Visualizing whether hits and completed passes are independent
par(mar = c(5, 4, 0, 1))
mosaicplot(table("QB Hit" = nfl_cp_tf$qb_hit,
                 "Completed Pass" = nfl_cp_tf$complete_pass),
           main = "",
           shade = TRUE) # Shading by pearson residuals
```

---

### How do pass completions vary as a team gets closer to halftime/the end of the game?

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
nfl_passing_plays %>%
  filter(complete_pass == "1") %>%
  select(game_half, half_seconds_remaining, complete_pass) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=half_seconds_remaining)) +
  geom_histogram(center = 1700, binwidth = 200, fill = "purple") +
  scale_x_reverse(breaks = seq(1800, 0, by = -200)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 900) +
  labs(x = "Seconds Remaining", y = "Complete Passes") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(game_half ~., ncol = 2)
```

---

## At what yardage range do NFL QBs complete the most passes? Where are they the most accurate?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create density curve for air yardage, colored by completions
nfl_density_curve <- nfl_cp_tf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=air_yards,
             color = complete_pass)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="red",
                              "TRUE"="blue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Pass Distance (in Yards)",
       y = "Number of Passes") +
  theme(legend.position = "blank")

# Create ECDF  for air yardage, colored by completions
nfl_ecdf <- nfl_cp_tf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=air_yards,
             color = complete_pass)) +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="red",
                              "TRUE"="blue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Pass Distance (in Yards)",
       y = "Proportion of Passes",
       color = "Pass Completed")

# Combine plots
nfl_density_curve + nfl_ecdf + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
```

## Minimax Clustering by Total EPA and Total Yards Gained Per Player

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Minimax clustering

# Compute the distance (euclidean)
player_clust <- nfl_passing_plays %>%
  group_by(passer_player_name) %>%
  summarize(total_yards = sum(yards_gained), epa = sum(epa))

player_clust <- player_clust %>%
  filter(total_yards > 500) # Remove players with less than 500 total yds

player_clust_std <- player_clust %>%
  mutate(std_total_yards = as.numeric(scale(total_yards)),
                                      std_epa = as.numeric(scale(epa)))

player_dist <- dist(dplyr::select(player_clust_std, 
                    std_total_yards, 
                    std_epa))

nfl_protoclust <- protoclust(player_dist)

# Minimax clustering
minimax_player_clusters <- protocut(nfl_protoclust, k = 4)

player_clust_std %>%
  mutate(player_clusters = 
           as.factor(minimax_player_clusters$cl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = std_total_yards, y = std_epa,
             color = player_clusters)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Clustering with prototypes
nfl_prototypes <- player_clust_std %>%
  mutate(player_clusters = 
           as.factor(minimax_player_clusters$cl)) %>%
  slice(minimax_player_clusters$protos)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
player_clust_std %>%
  mutate(player_clusters = 
           as.factor(minimax_player_clusters$cl)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = std_total_yards,
             y = std_epa, color = player_clusters)) +
  geom_point(data = mutate(nfl_prototypes,
                           player_clusters = as.factor(c(1,2,3,4))),
             size = 4) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_label(data = nfl_prototypes, 
             aes(label = passer_player_name), 
             size = 4,
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Total Yards (Standardized)",
       y = "EPA (Standardized)",
       color = "QB Clusters") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Conclusions

--

- Investing in the offensive line pays off, as QBs less likely to complete passes when hit.

--

- There is a higher proportion of passes completed at the end of each half relative to the rest of the game.

--

- Most passes are around 5-10 yards in the air, and these passes are most accurate.

--

- Players can be grouped by total yards and expected points added in a way that reflects quarterback performance across the league.

--

## Limitations

--

- No positional data, which prevents location-based data analysis (such as passing heat maps).

--

- No ball tracking data, which can be used to further analyze QB performance.

--

- Data is limited to the 2021 season, and only includes the regular season.
